# BIOL-497
University of Alaska Biol 497 Machine Learning in the Cloud

## Description
This direct study taught the foundations and the applications of machine learning and it's software in the
Data Sciences, primarily finding signals in data, inference from predictions, workflows, and
database applications using ‘cloud-based’ methods. The course came about as a series of lectures with three labs and one final project. 
The first two labs involved developing workflows for ML models using Salford Predictive Modeler. [The third lab](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/BIOL-497/blob/main/Coursework/Exploring%20Cloud%20Databases%20Lab.pdf) was an exploration on cloud database management services, we built a dashboard with three different backends (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure). [The final project](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/BIOL-497/blob/main/Coursework/Final%20Project%20Files/ML_Final%20Project.pdf) involved modeling the population of Rock Ptarmagin in Iceland using GIS data.
